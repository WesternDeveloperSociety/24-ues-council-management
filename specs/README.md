# PROJECT NAME Specs

## Summary

The WDS Council Management Project, in collaboration with the Undergraduate Engineering Society at Western, aims to automate council meetings and the recording of votes and attendance. Presently, the UES uses a system called Robert's Rules when managing speaking order. An alternative was proposed with digitizes and enhances the system. This council management application would automate speaking order, attendance/proxies, and publish the result of each motion's vote to a public facing web app.
